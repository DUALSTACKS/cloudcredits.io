intro: >-
  The IonQ Research Credits Program offers up to $10,000 in free credits for
  time on their quantum computers to qualified academics, supporting the future
  of quantum information science.
description: >-
  IonQ's Research Credits Program supports academic and research institutions by
  providing access to up to $10,000 in quantum computing credits. These credits
  help defray the cost of accessing IonQ's advanced quantum systems—including
  Harmony, Aria, Forte, and upcoming models—and come with technical support and
  direct feedback from IonQ's experts. With a fast review process (typically
  within three business days) and flexible usage for research and educational
  projects, the program is ideal for initiatives in quantum computing research,
  algorithm development, curriculum design, and open-source tool creation.
  Credits cannot be used for commercial or personal projects.
