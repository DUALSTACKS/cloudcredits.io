  Customer.io's Startup Program empowers early-stage startups with subsidized
  access to a sophisticated customer engagement platform. The program offers two
  tailored plans – Startup Basic and Startup +Plus – providing options for free
  access or subsidized pricing at $100/month. Eligible startups must have raised
  less than $10M, use organically acquired contacts, and be new to Customer.io's
  paid services. Key features include multi-channel messaging (email, SMS, push
  notifications), behavioral tracking, segmentation, A/B testing, API access,
  and integrations. Additionally, startups benefit from a robust partner network
  offering extended credits, cross-platform discounts, and priority reviews,
  with partners like Y Combinator, Techstars, Mercury Banking, and AWS Activate.
  After the 12-month period, startups transition to paid plans.
