  premium features including advanced integrations (with Google Sheets, Zapier,
  and Slack), customizable templates for forms, CRMs, quizzes, and client
  portals, real-time analytics, collaborative workspaces, and access to
  relational databases and AI-powered tools. It is designed for startups that
  have raised no more than $5 million, launched less than 5 years ago, are

  Free plan. Startups can also benefit from priority approval if they work with
  Formaloo’s global partners.
