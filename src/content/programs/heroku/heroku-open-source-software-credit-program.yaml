description: >-
  The Heroku Open Source Software Credit Program is designed to support open
  source projects by providing monthly platform credits over a 12-month period.
  Credits, typically ranging from $25 to $500 USD per month, can be applied
  exclusively to core Heroku services such as Dynos, Postgres, and Key-Value
  Store. Any usage beyond the allocated credits is billed at standard rates to
  the verified credit/debit card on file. Projects can reapply annually to
  continue receiving support, ensuring that maintainers can focus on community
  contributions rather than infrastructure concerns.
