meta_title: Twentysix Cloud Acceleratooor - Decentralized Cloud Credits for Web3 Startups
intro: >-
  Develop your project, launch it on aleph.im, and benefit from community
  recognition. Access up to $1M ALEPH credits for 1 year to deploy decentralized
  VMs, storage, and websites on a resilient, decentralized cloud.
description: >-
  The Twentysix Cloud Acceleratooor Web3 Startup Program offers a $1M grant in
  ALEPH credits and infrastructure support for blockchain projects building
  decentralized applications (dApps). It provides decentralized compute
  instances, IPFS-based storage, cross-chain interoperability (support for
  Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Mode, Solana, Ethereum, and OP Superchain), and
  dedicated mentorship. This program is designed for early-stage projects with
  an MVP or POC, without requiring VC or institutional funding, and operates
  with a manual application review process without KYC/KYB.
