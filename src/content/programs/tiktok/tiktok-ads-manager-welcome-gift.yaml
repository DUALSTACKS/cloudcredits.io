  TikTok's Ads Manager Welcome Gift program offers new advertisers a lucrative
  opportunity to kickstart their campaigns with dollar-for-dollar matched
  credits. Unlock benefits through tiered spending thresholds: spend $100 to
  receive $100, $500 to receive $500, and $1,500 to receive $1,500. After a new
  account registration, participants have a 30-day redemption period to reach
  their desired tier, with credits applied 1-7 days after meeting spending
  requirements. The program integrates organic and paid strategies, such as
  Spark Ads, to maximize campaign impact. Eligibility is limited to new TikTok
  Ads Manager accounts in selected regions, and all credits expire on February
