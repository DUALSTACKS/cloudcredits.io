  Retool’s Startup Program provides a comprehensive package for early-stage
  startups by offering a 100% off coupon for one year on monthly Team or
  Business plans. Eligible startups—those bootstrapped, angel-funded,
  debt-funded, pre-seed, seed, or Series A with less than $10M raised and
  founded within the last 10 years—must upgrade their plan and apply. Upon
  approval, the discount is automatically applied to the first invoice. In
  addition to free access, participants gain access to significant partner deals
  including credits and discounts from AWS, Brex, Twilio Segment, Zendesk, and
  DigitalOcean. After the free period, a 25% discount is offered for continued
  access.
