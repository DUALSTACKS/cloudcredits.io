faq:
  - question: How are credits converted to build minutes?
    answer: >-
      On a Linux Medium resource class, 1 credit is approximately 0.2 minutes,
      so 400,000 credits equate to about 80,000 build minutes on a small Docker
      instance.

      No, credits on the free plan expire at the end of each month and do not
      roll over.
