faq:
  - question: "What are the general requirements for Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub?"
    answer: "Applicants must be privately held, for-profit, building a software-based product or service, and have not reached Series D funding or used more than $10k in Azure credits previously."
  - question: "Do I need external funding or a specific stage to qualify?"
    answer: "No. Microsoft for Startups accepts startups at all stages, even if they have no external funding. You simply move through levels as your usage and business grow."
  - question: "How long do the credits last?"
    answer: "Azure credits expire 12 months after you are granted a tier’s credits or once you fully consume them, whichever comes first. Upgrading tiers typically resets the 12-month clock."
  - question: "Can I use the credits for GPU-based AI workloads?"
    answer: "Yes. GPU quotas may require a separate request or approval, especially for high-demand regions, but many participants have successfully obtained them through support tickets."
  - question: "Are there vendor lock-in penalties or fees for the program?"
    answer: "No. There are no fees or explicit lock-in requirements. However, once your sponsorship credits expire, you become responsible for any ongoing usage costs."
