  The Front for Startups Program is designed to help early-stage companies scale
  their customer support operations without upfront costs. Through this program,
  new Front customers—who have fewer than 50 employees and have raised up to
  $10M in external funding—gain complimentary access to the Growth plan, which
  consolidates various communication channels (email, social media, SMS, voice)
  into a centralized platform. The program also provides AI-powered automation
  to streamline workflows and enhance response efficiency. After the 6-month
  free period, startups are prompted to upgrade to a paid plan to maintain
  service continuity.
