faq:
  - question: "How do I sign up for the free trial?"
    answer: "Use Google or GitHub single sign-on, or provide your email to create a new account. A valid payment method is required for identity verification. Promotional credits are available only to new customers who have not previously signed up for a free trial."
  - question: "What can I do with my free trial?"
    answer: "Once you complete the sign-up process, you can use your credit towards many Compute plans (GPU plans are excluded), Object Storage, Block Storage, or NodeBalancers offerings. If you exceed the allotted credit amount within the 60-day trial period, the overage will be charged at standard rates."
  - question: "What forms of payment do you accept?"
    answer: "Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, PayPal, and Google Pay with an associated credit card are all accepted. Additional options like wire transfer, purchase orders, and ACH are available upon request. Note that a temporary pre-authorization request may be sent to your bank, which will be immediately released but may take a few days to clear."
  - question: "What happens after my trial period ends?"
    answer: "You must spend your service credits during the trial period. Unused service credits will automatically expire, and you will be charged standard rates for any service over the allotted credit amount."
  - question: "How do I apply for business credits?"
    answer: "Business customers can apply for up to $5,000 in credits through the business application process. No credit card or pre-authorization is required, and you can pay via wire transfer, purchase order, ACH, and more."
